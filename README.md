# Grimoire 📖

**Your ARPG build guides, one button press away.**

Grimoire is a [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader)
plugin for the Steam Deck that keeps your build guides in the Quick Access
overlay. Stuck on which affix to keep, what skill to take at level 32, or how
to path your paragon board? Press <kbd>...</kbd> instead of reaching for your
phone.

Supports **Diablo 4** (Mobalytics, Maxroll, d4builds.gg) and **Path of Exile 2**
(Mobalytics), with a provider system for adding other ARPGs.

## Features

- 📚 **Build library** — paste a guide link once, it's saved on your Deck
- ★ **Pin your current build** — it stays at the top of the list
- 🧩 **The whole build, right in the overlay** — skills, gear, stat
  priorities, paragon boards, charms and mercenaries, without leaving your
  game. ✱ marks the stats worth a Greater Affix, and tempering,
  masterworking and sockets are all spelled out per item.
- 🔀 **Build variants** — Starter, Endgame, Pushing... switch between a
  guide's variants with one dropdown.
- ↕️ **Your order** — mostly check gear? Move that section up once and it
  stays first, in every build.
- ✅ **Leveling checklist** — check off skills and steps as you take them;
  Grimoire remembers where you left off, per build and variant.
- 📝 **Notes** — jot down your own reminders on any build, right in the
  panel.
- 🌐 **Open full guide** — for the details only the full page has (like
  paragon pathing), jump to the guide in the built-in browser while your
  game keeps running.
- 📴 **Works offline** — your library lives on the Deck; a saved build is
  readable with no connection.

PoE2 Mobalytics guides include build variants, skill gems with linked
supports, both weapon sets, equipment stats, flasks, charms, named passive
priorities, ascendancy choices and quest rewards. Use **Open full guide**
for the visual passive tree, socket details and the author's full explanations.

If a featured Mobalytics PoE2 page is blocked, Grimoire tries the site's
public guide-data endpoint. Browser verification pages such as "Just a
moment..." are reported as fetch failures if recovery fails, instead of
being saved as guide titles. A failed refresh keeps
previously saved data. After updating the plugin, use **Refresh from source**
on an existing guide to load its PoE2 sections.

### Roadmap

- More PoE2 providers, Last Epoch and the Decky store

## Installation

Grimoire is not in the Decky store yet. The easiest way to try it: grab
`decky-grimoire.zip` from the latest [release](../../releases/latest) and
use Decky's *Developer → Install plugin from zip* (requires developer mode
in Decky settings). Fresh-from-main builds are also available as
[Actions](../../actions) artifacts.

To build from source instead:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Then copy the plugin to your Deck (or develop with
[decky-cli](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/cli) / VS Code deploy tasks
from the plugin template). The zip layout Decky expects is:

```
decky-grimoire/
├── dist/index.js      # built frontend
├── main.py            # backend entry point
├── py_modules/        # backend modules
├── plugin.json
└── package.json
```

## Development

- **Frontend** — `src/index.tsx`, React via
  [@decky/ui](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-frontend-lib) +
  [@decky/api](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-api).
  `npm run watch` rebuilds on change.
- **Backend** — `main.py` + `py_modules/grimoire/`. Pure stdlib Python
  (no vendored dependencies needed). Builds and preferences are stored as
  JSON in the plugin settings directory.
- **Providers** — `py_modules/grimoire/providers/` contains each site's parser.
  `mobalytics_poe2.py` handles PoE2 data and the featured-guide API fallback.
  Failed parsing still saves the link for opening in the browser.
- **Validating parsers** — guide sites redesign freely; when a provider
  stops yielding sections, re-check it from a normal network with
  `python3 scripts/validate_live.py <guide-url>`. Title but no sections =
  that provider needs work; open an issue with the output.
